    "transcript": "So if you never tried korean beauty before you want a really simple routine this is how you start K-beauty is iconic for the double cleanse number one cleansing oil and k-beauty is the inua cleansing oil This is the cleansing oil that draws all the sebum out white dot is a sebaceous filament It draws it all out keeping your nose really clean after doing it for about 60 seconds You have to emulsify it with water wash it off completely go in with a water-based cleanser This is the best one for pores Pour deep cleansing foam gets into all those chin pores clean your pores from inside out uses heartleaf powder Creates really dense bubbles like the ones you see on my face right now dense bubbles are able to foam into your pores Helps to gently clear all the impurities from your pores This is the cleanser that always makes my skin feel really clean You have to wash it away with water again and then completely dry your skin Cleanser is perfect for those with sensitive skin Main ingredient is heartleaf leaves your skin feeling really clean but not tight korean beauty My favorite way to exfoliate is using toner pads selimax bha toner pads And the most popular toner pads in korea two sides It has a gauze side and a smooth side skin You should always use the smooth side because you don't want to damage your barrier outside might be too harsh for some skin types This is the perfect exfoliation If you have textured skin how I use the gauze side So I use the gauze side behind my ears because behind the ears is the sebum zone Use it to purify the back of my ears. Sometimes the gauze pad turns yellow. That's all sebum Then I go in with a bean essence vegan version of snail mucin the same texture same benefits So textured skin hydration and helps you heal a damage barrier This is really transform my skin because it helps with my skin's overall radiance and texture skin gets really Clogged usually but bean essence really helps that because it contains fermented pomegranate That's a natural aha and I use fermented centella asiatica Fermented centella asiatica helps control blemishes in your skin. I have any redness It's going to calm it down. So it helps control the sebum production. So helps dark spots and any hyperpigmentation Use your skin with a glossy glass skin finish. That's why I love using fermented centella asiatica To lock in all of that with a cream My favorite is this mixsoon bean cream found that this cream leaves my skin feeling so hydrated and it leaves my skin really glassy But it doesn't have that sticky finish the creams I use have that really sticky finish Leaves your skin feeling Really sticky all day just getting into k-beauty and you just want a really simple routine is exactly what I would use",

When you use a moisturizer, you moisturize your skin. Now you've cleansed, hydrated, brightened, prevented wrinkles, and moisturized your skin. And if you use sunscreen, you protect your skin.

    "transcript": "It's not clocking to you that if you want your skin to look like this Then this is the only skincare routine that you need lock in because classes in session You have blackheads clogged pores then you need to double cleanse if you wear makeup say it with me We need to double cleanse you want to go in with an oil cleanser first. I love this one This one's a bio dance cleansing oil just melting off all my makeup always give your nose some extra love because we don't want any Strawberry no, I don't know about you, but I prefer to eat strawberries instead of having on my face You're gonna feel dead skin. Just start rolling off. You guys see that emulsify Just add a little bit of water work it into your skin more than rinse foaming cleanser This is what actually cleans your skin If you just use an oil cleanser and you don't go in with a foam cleanser to be honest You're not really washing your face. It's what's gonna get that extra dirt gunk and residue out manio pure and deep cleansing foam I'm telling you nothing cleanses my face like that cleanser rinse. It is giving squeaky clean, but now she's dry road glazing milk She's thick she's creamy and this is an essence So it's not a toner and it's not a serum low key. I kind of have been replacing my toner with this This has ceramides in it. So it's really great for your skin barrier I'm gonna show you guys how thick this stuff is Like if I shake my head, she's barely moving the glow just from the glazing milk alone It's kind of unruly if you don't know this already PDR and is derived from salmon sperm Yeah, you heard that right PRN really helps with acne marks. It calms inflammation It's very hydrating also helps increase collagen production. Now. We have one of my favorite girls a toyed in diving See, I solely use this for the purpose of hydration This is made from hyaluronic acid and it's a skincare brand that people in Korea actually you if you have very dehydrated and sensitive skin You need this prickly pear peptide mucin from glow recipe. Like do you guys see how much I use? I've literally only been using it for a few weeks. This is phyto mucin which is an alternative to snail mucin The consistency is super thin almost looks like snot, but I can't even lie. This stuff makes my skin feel so good This is why I bust out my Medi-Q booster that asked this device changed my life every time It's like music to my ears after you use this your skin the next day insane. It's like you're being reborn So I just go in with the booster mode and I just kind of like go upwards like this This is just gonna basically help absorb your skincare. I don't really know the science behind it. Not gonna lie It kind of does feel like needles. Sorry guys. Sometimes beauty is pain. PDRN cream This is a sister of this serum It's composed of the same stuff But this will just basically help seal everything in kind of just like a protective blanket This stuff is thick but I mean look at that glow in PDRN We trust shout out to salmon because not only do you taste good, but you also look good on my face We're gonna finish off with eye gel this one from belief. It has a really cool applicator tip We do not want any eye bags when we wake up in the morning good old Vaseline like we can't go wrong with this and Look how cute this is. She's bedazzled as someone who has chronically dry lips. Sometimes you just have to go back to the basics Let's look at my skin. Shall we?",

Is it not? I'm not gonna know until I edit the video So you let me know And also let me know how much your skincare routine is",

    "transcript": "Is this fine? No, is it if you move? If you, no, move now. Move, you know Sabi, contour nose. As, as, as old as you are this low-budget girl. Eh? You know Sabi, not to you Sabi. This is new year. Respect yourself, even I will break your teeth. Carry your tulle and come to the front chair. With this low-budget premature ekuke. Come forward y'all. Nonsense. And since you don't carry your twin stick, come front chair. What you need to contour your nose is just two items. If you like, go and pack all your food, shabu shabu and rub for your face. Now you Sabi, now take this now. This is the L-A-G-E-R concealer. You can use any DAKAR shade of concealer you have. But make sure it's a shade or two shade DAKAR than your exact tone. Now take this now. Put at the back of your palm on a flat surface. Don't begin to rub. Ehe, every spot in between. Fiam, fiam, fiam. You this low-budget girl. You know you're Basira or you're Confort that is selling cough puff. With your big big eye like Robo Robo Stone. See your mouth like Wissu. Come, let's see. Okay. Okay. What you put this way. Ehe. Take a brush. Carry brush. You get that for Adam so you don't get him. Carry any brush. If you don't get, go and start selling moe moe. Take this now. Alright. If you want to start applying your nose contour. Some of you, now every children that watch for online. You they follow Oyebo online. You watch Oyebo applying concealer here. For nose contour. You will not smell your 85 teeth that is not even complete. And go and follow them and do the same thing. Knowing fully well. That God have blessed those white people. With natural pointed nose. Oyana. Eyalati. Look at your nose. No, no, no, no. Look your nose for Miro. Your nose is as white as Olu Moruk. Your nose and pillar of glory. Very white like clay pots. You're not going to follow somebody that have pointed nose to apply concealer here and here. And you expect your nose to be contoured. How is that possible? Madam. How is that possible? Come to the front here. You want to start from this angle here. This is your eyebrow area. Place the first concealer here like this. You come here. You place the concealer here. If you like. Allow your man to kiss you there. No look up. No let make up. No let make up. Come here. So they bring her down. Slowly this way. Begin to bring this downward. Now you are drawing the concealer to stop here. I call this on top of the nose. This is the side. There is difference between here and here. I don't want to know where you start drawing your nose contour. If you like. Start from the back of your neck. Madam. Madam. Mommy. It should stop here. Not here. Kajiko. Do the same step in this other side. You bring this downward. Just like this. You stop right here in this middle part. Now you are done with this particular step. You want to start blending. Now take a damp beauty sponge. At this stage you start dripping. I must make you drip. A damp beauty sponge. Make sure it is wet a little bit. Now you want to come here slowly. You start doing your tum tum tum tum method. I am not dragging anything. Come. As you see here. At the top. You get mind to make noise. If I remove your two front teeth. If I remove your two front teeth. With this low budget bunch of banana. Carry yourself. Come here. You start doing your tum tum like this. You blend. Now don't worry if the concealer is coming under the eye area. Don't worry. Just focus on what you are doing. You blend. You bring this up right here. Slowly. Don't worry if it is coming above your brow hair. Focus on what you are doing. Beautiful. Repeat the same step on this other side. Alright. You blend. Like I said. Focus on what you are doing. Don't worry if it is coming on your eyes. Or if it is coming above your brow hair. You are going to fix everything. Focus. Aha. Voila. Are you seeing that? Beautiful. We are done with this particular step. You see the way our nose now is looking like a low budget premature avatar Kyoshi. Right now we are looking like Alvin and the Chipmunks. You see the way our nose is. Very classless. Let's fix this harsh line that is here. Take this beauty sponge. Alright. Come on top of this line. Slow and steady. Don't run. Come here. You start doing your tum tum method. Don't drag. Don't drag. You are the single witch. Don't drag. Hey. Come here. You start doing your tum tum method. Begin to bring this up right here. You blend. Like this. On top of that line. You come here. Aha. You blend that very well. On top of that line. Small. Small. Beautiful. Are you seeing that nose contour right now? Show me in front of your eye. No. No. No. See the way the nose contour and contour have been no contour. Show you the same. Go do rubbish. Oh. Majority of you are going to be asking me. And beauty God. What about you that that is black. Even if it's coming down to my eyes. How do I fix it? Mommy. Calm down. Take another beauty sponge. This was a beauty sponge. We used to blend the nose contour right. Don't use this one. Take another separate one. That's used in blending your under eyes. Because I have concealer here already. For my highlighting. Take it. Alright. Take the beauty sponge. Take the beauty. Don't add any other products. Just come to the side. Alright. Tap that side very well. That dark shade. It will fade it out. Don't add any product please. Come here. You want to tap all the dark shade area this way. To fade it out. You see. Show you the same. You see the difference between here now. And here. Show you the same. Apropos. Show you the same. Good. Same step on this other side. You want to fade all the darker shade. Like this. You just touch only the dark shade area. Eh. Hey. Aibo. Voila. Eh. You see the nose contour. The contour. Show you the same. Everything is snatched. Show you the same. If you like eh. Carry your too chunistic premature leg. Like dog foul. Go and do rubbish. Don't do your makeup. When you see manly twins. When he is married. Hmm. You do single witch. Don't go marry him. See. In this year. I want to go marry this person. She loves rice. If you like eh. Go do anyhow. Oh yeah. Go eat and see no more. Go and do your makeup. Go ahead. Oh.",

    "transcript": "Quick, get ready for me to go out. This is my outfit. Not fancy at all. I'm wearing sweats. First time not wearing jeans in a while. But let's go do my makeup. Okay, so I'm going to use makeup that I don't really usually use because, like, I don't really want to waste, like, my main product that I always wear. So I'm going to start off with this e.l.f. blush that is, like, so freaking pigmented and I'm scared every time I put it on because I, as some of you might know, I have a very big fear of getting blush blindness so I kind of have, like, the opposite of blush blindness and I don't put enough on, but yeah. Like, come on. I don't think, you can't really see it in this lighting. It's so bright. Guys, what, what? Okay, fixed it. Now you can't see anything at all, which is the way I like it. I only have a different thing for contour so I just use this brown one. Yeah, I know, contour is supposed to be grey. I'm going to call this contour anyways. This is my nose contour. I really just finger blend it and I like highlighting that I have a nose bump kind of at the end of my nose. Nose contour is done and it looks a little sus. I'm going to do my lashes, though. My spiky lashes, I don't know what's going on with them today. Uh, yeah. My lashes are done. Um, what am I going to do now? Wait. I'm going to do my lip liner now, but I don't want to use my PLF one so I'm going to use this Milani one that I stole from my sister. Okay, I don't think they care about me lining my lips, actually. I don't mind. Hmm, cherry flavor. I want to taste, but not actually unless you're Cooper Hoffman or Ray Garrity. Yeah. Um, and that's basically it. I will be using Peppermint Cashmere. I put glasses on to hide how bad my lashes were. And that's it. Bye.",

    "transcript": "花絮 hello 大家好我是壯壯 今天想以這個眼珠珠的配色為靈感來畫一個彩色系的妝容 我在糾結這兩顆藍色 這顆的話我有點怕他太過搶眼了 這個的話有感覺他不夠藍 大膽一點直接就用這顆藍色 就把多餘的粉抖掉 抖的時候一定要在垃圾桶的上方去抖 不要怕一開始他不上色 大概的定一個色塊 最近的臉有點太乾了 其實我有點怕我的眼皮過會兒會不上色 皮膚太乾的話那一塊可能就會上不去顏色 小範圍的去打個底 暈染的話用這顆薄荷綠 這步暈染要用這種稍微蓬鬆一點的刷子 就是抖掉多餘的粉 沿著之前眼影的邊緣去暈 慢慢地一點一點地去暈 暈到這個藍色眼影的邊緣是模糊的 沒有一個很實的色塊就可以了 他跟這個薄荷綠是融合起來的就可以 繼續這顆藍色的從睫毛根部 慢慢地往外面去暈 暈到整個眼影的大概二分之一到三分之一就可以了 這個刷子上的餘粉去帶一下邊緣 覺得邊緣有銜接不上的地方就少量地沾取一點點 輕輕地把這個地方掃一下 去銜接一下就可以 顏色一定不要上的太實了 又開始糾結中間抹什麼顏色了 我有點怕他太割裂了 但是真的挺喜歡這一顆的 這顆也是一個變色龍 先用這顆黃綠色的去打個底 有點過於顯色了 這顆鹹菜綠 敷在下眼瞼 然後再用這顆黃綠色的去打底 然後再用這顆黃綠色的 打一下臥蠶 還是純白色的 提亮眼頭 今天整體的色調想要濃郁一些 所以腮紅用一個這種梅子色的 團狀點綴在面中 大概就是你鼻翼的這個地方 膨脹色腮紅去掃邊緣 小範圍的去點綴加深 下面就是我修修補補 塗塗改改的時間 還是決定用這顆亮片 上眼之後其實感覺也還好 我怕他是那種很橘很橘的顏色 這兩個亮片的中間稍微的去交疊一下 下面就是亮片疊疊樂時間 今天怎麼摸的這麼油啊 高光用沙漠與海的藍色部分 然後是這個粉色部分 疊加在下眼瞼的前半部分 然後是這個粉色部分 疊加在下眼瞼的前半部分 然後是這個粉色部分 疊加在下眼瞼的前半部分 疊加在下眼瞼的前半部分 上睫毛還是這個 上睫毛還是這個 絕版小亮片 他是那種大顆的蔥片 拍出來就會比較明顯 把這邊的嘴角畫出來 先用一支這種土棕色的給嘴巴打個底 用刷子把邊緣暈開 我最後還會疊一下105這一支 就是一個帶細閃的這種灰灰的顏色 灰紫色的 但是我過會兒想去吃點東西 所以就先不抹了 然後今天的妝就化完啦 掰",
